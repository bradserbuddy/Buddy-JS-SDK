# Buddy JavaScript SDK

## Overview

The Buddy JavaScript SDK helps you get up and running in seconds.  

For the most part, the Buddy JavaScript SDK takes care of all the housekeeping of making requests against the Buddy REST API:

* Building and formatting requests
* Managing authentication
* Parsing responses
* Loading and saving credentials

With that handled, all you have to do is initialize the SDK and start making some calls!

## Getting Started

To get started with the Buddy Platform SDK, please reference the _Getting Started_ series of documents at [docs.buddy.com](https://docs.buddy.com). You will need an application ID and key before you can use the SDK. The _Getting Started_ documents will walk you through obtaining everything you need and show you where to find the SDK for your platform.

Application IDs and keys are obtained at the Buddy Developer Dashboard at [buddyplatform.com](https://buddyplatform.com/login).

Full documentation for Buddy's services are available at [docs.buddy.com](https://docs.buddy.com).

### Installing the SDK

1) Clone the repo to your desktop

    git clone https://github.com/BuddyPlatform/Buddy-JS-SDK.git

2) Move the *buddy.js* file to a convenient location within your project

3) Create or open your HTML project

4) Add the following lines to your `<HEAD>...</HEAD>` tags or at the end of `<BODY>` before any other JavaScript

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="buddy.js"></script>

## Using the JavaScript SDK

Visit the [Buddy Dashboard](https://buddyplatform.com) to obtain your application ID and key.

### Initialize the SDK

`Buddy.init('[your app id]', '[your app key]');`

*You may see the word "Undefined" appear in your console here. This is not an error, it is simply JavaScript's way of notifying you that the Buddy.init call does not return a value.*

### User Flow

The Buddy JavaScript SDK handles user creation and login.

#### Create A User
	
	// Only username and password are required
	Buddy.createUser({
	  username: 'test',
	  password: 'password',
	  firstName: 'Test',
	  lastName: 'User',
	  email: 'test@test.com',
	  dob: '4/23/1980'
	}, [callback]);

#### User Login
	
	// All functions from here on out accept callbacks
	// Callbacks are optional in the JavaScript SDK as indicated by the [ ]
	Buddy.loginUser('test', 'password', [callback]);

#### User Logout

	Buddy.logoutUser();

### REST Interface

Each SDK provides wrappers that make REST calls to Buddy.

#### POST

In this example we'll create a checkin. Take a look at the [create checkin REST documentation](http://docs.buddy.com/docs/create-checkin) then:

	// POST to Checkins
	// Location is required
	Buddy.post('/checkins', {location: '34.052, -118.243', description: 'Somewhere in LA'}, [callback]);

#### GET

We now can call GET to [search for the checkin](https://docs.buddy.com/docs/search-checkins) we just created!

	// GET a checkin by ID
	var checkinId;
	Buddy.get('/checkins/' + checkinId, [callback]);

#### PUT/PATCH/DELETE

Each remaining REST verb is available through the Buddy SDK using the same pattern as the POST and GET examples.

### Working With Files

Buddy offers support for binary files. The JavaScript SDK works with files through our REST interface similarly to other API calls.

**Note:** Responses for files deviate from the standard Buddy response templates. See the [Buddy Platform documentation](https://docs.buddy.com/docs) for more information.

#### Upload A File

Here we demonstrate uploading a picture. For all binary files (e.g. blobs and videos), the pattern is the same, but with a different path and different parameters. For full documentation see our [Media and Files](https://docs.buddy.com/docs/create-picture) documentation page.

	// This example assumes both of the following HTML elements exist:
	// <input type="file" id="file" name="file" />
	// <input id="uploadButton" type="button" value="Upload" />

	$('#uploadButton').click(function() {
	  
	  var inputFile = $('#file')[0];
	  
	  var myImage = inputFile.files[0];
	  
	  Buddy.post('/pictures', {data: myImage});  
	  
	});

#### Download A File

Due to browser limitations the JavaScript SDK does not support direct file downloads.
